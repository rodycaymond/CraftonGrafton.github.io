The alpha version of the Crafton Grafton game (without graphics) check out the game at rodycaymond.github.io/CraftonGrafton.github.io/
I am a novice in the world of web dev (which may or may not be obvious) and this was my first attempt at creating a game in browser.
The real purpose behind the game was to discover more things about web dev and learn more of the JS and HTML language and functionalities.
It may not the be the right answer, but I basically used this as practice and to see how well I am able to use my knowledge of the languages to create something unique,
and original. I suppose it was also a challenge to myself to see if I could use what I know to create and do new things and test my understanding of the language.
Please give me any feedback you have! 
I currently serve in the military, but would like to pursue a career in web dev when I finally get out.
Thank you, and please enjoy!
(p.s. i know that there are bugs in the game and i understand that things probably could have been coded more efficiently/better, but the game works for the most part, 
and i'm too lazy to go back through and rewrite some of the things...lol)
